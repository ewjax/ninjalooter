Simulated Annealing Scoring System:

    Goal = maximum raid score
    General process:
        - based on number of players, identify the desired group types
        - execute the following pseudo-code:
            while (not converged)
                take the list of players and randomly assign them to group positions
                determine the score of the randomized change, using the below criteria
                if the score improves, keep the change
                if the score doesn't improve, MAYBE keep the change anyway
                    decision based on the system annealing "temperature"
                    "hotter" = more likely to accept the move, "colder" = less likely
                keep looping, slowly cooling off the system "temperature"
                the system is converged when no new score improvements are found

    Scoring criteria for any given group:
        MAX_SLOT = 100  # slot filled with an exact match
        MIN_SLOT = 10  # slot filled with anyone
        LEVEL_PENALTY = 15  # per level less than 60
        CLASS_PENALTY = 50  # penalty if not an exact class match
        GENERAL_PENALTY = 0.7  # penalize scores of players in general

    Example:  Assume we are trying to build a Tank group, and need a Warrior
        A level 60 warrior would receive a score of 100
        A level 58 warrior would receive a score of (100 - 2*15) = 70
        A level 58 paladin would receive a score of (100 - 50 - 2*15) = 20
        A level 60 enchanter would receive a score of 10
